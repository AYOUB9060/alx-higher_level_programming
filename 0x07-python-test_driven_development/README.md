# 0x07-python-test_driven_development

This directory contains Python scripts and test files related to the topic of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python. The scripts in this directory demonstrate the principles of TDD and provide examples of writing unit tests for Python code.

## Files

- `0-add_integer.py`: A Python script that defines a function to add two integers and includes corresponding unit tests.
- `2-matrix_divided.py`: A Python script that defines a function to divide a matrix by a scalar and includes corresponding unit tests.
- `3-say_my_name.py`: A Python script that defines a function to print a person's name and includes corresponding unit tests.
- `4-print_square.py`: A Python script that defines a function to print a square of a specified size and includes corresponding unit tests.
- `5-text_indentation.py`: A Python script that defines a function to add indentation to a text and includes corresponding unit tests.
- `100-matrix_mul.py`: A Python script that defines a function to multiply two matrices and includes corresponding unit tests.
- `101-lazy_matrix_mul.py`: A Python script that defines a function to lazily multiply two matrices and includes corresponding unit tests.
- `102-python.c`: A C source file that contains a Python C extension module.
- `tests/`: A directory that contains test files for each script:
  - `0-add_integer.txt`: A text file containing sample test cases for the `0-add_integer.py` script.
  - `100-matrix_mul.txt`: A text file containing sample test cases for the `100-matrix_mul.py` script.
  - `101-lazy_matrix_mul.txt`: A text file containing sample test cases for the `101-lazy_matrix_mul.py` script.
  - `2-matrix_divided.txt`: A text file containing sample test cases for the `2-matrix_divided.py` script.
  - `3-say_my_name.txt`: A text file containing sample test cases for the `3-say_my_name.py` script.
  - `4-print_square.txt`: A text file containing sample test cases for the `4-print_square.py` script.
  - `5-text_indentation.txt`: A text file containing sample test cases for the `5-text_indentation.py` script.
  - `6-max_integer_test.py`: A Python script containing unit tests for an additional module that finds the maximum integer in a list.
