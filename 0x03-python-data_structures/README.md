#0x03-python-data_structures

This directory contains Python and C scripts and programs related to the topic of lists and tuples in Python. It covers various concepts and operations associated with these data structures.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basics of lists and tuples in Python
- Create and manipulate lists and tuples
- Access and modify elements in lists and tuples
- Perform common operations on lists and tuples, such as slicing, concatenation, and sorting
- Use built-in functions and methods for lists and tuples
- Apply list comprehensions to generate lists efficiently
- Understand the differences between lists and tuples and choose the appropriate data structure for different scenarios

## Files

Here is a brief description of the files in this directory:

- `0-print_list_integer.py`: A Python script that prints all integers of a list, one integer per line, using the `str.format()` method.
- `1-element_at.py`: A Python script that defines a function to retrieve an element from a list based on a given index.
- `2-replace_in_list.py`: A Python script that defines a function to replace an element in a list at a specific position.
- `3-main.py`: A Python script that serves as a main program for testing various functionalities related to lists and tuples.
- `4-new_in_list.py`: A Python script that defines a function to replace an element in a copied list at a specific position.
- `5-no_c.py`: A Python script that removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.
- `6-print_matrix_integer.py`: A Python script that prints a matrix of integers.
- `7-add_tuple.py`: A Python script that adds two tuples element-wise.
- `8-multiple_returns.py`: A Python script that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
- `9-max_integer.py`: A Python script that finds the maximum integer in a list.
- `10-divisible_by_2.py`: A Python script that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
- `11-delete_at.py`: A Python script that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
- `12-switch.py`: A Python script that switches the values of two variables.
- `13-is_palindrome.c`: A C program that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
- `100-print_python_list_info.c`: A C program that prints basic information about Python lists, such as size and allocation.
- `100-test_lists.py`: A Python script that tests the `print_python_list_info` function from the C program using various list operations.
- `linked_lists.c`: A C program that implements various operations on linked lists.
- `lists.h`: A header file containing function prototypes for linked list operations.
